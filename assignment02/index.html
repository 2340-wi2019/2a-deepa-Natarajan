        <strong><span id=lady></span></strong> lived in the midst of the great <strong><span id=state></span></strong> ,
        <strong><span id=Geo> , </span></strong> with Uncle <strong><span id=man></span></strong> , who was a 
        <strong><span id=job></span></strong> ,and Aunt <strong><span id=woman></span></strong> , who was the
         farmer's wife.
		Their house was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon many miles. 
		There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one room; and this room contained a rusty 
        looking <strong><span id=noun1></span></strong> ,a <strong><span id=noun2></span></strong> for the dishes, 
        a table, three or four chairs, and the beds. Uncle <strong><span id=man1></span></strong>
         and Aunt <strong><span id=woman1></span></strong> had a big bed in one corner,
		and <strong><span id=lady1></span></strong> a little bed in another corner. There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a small hole dug
        in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family would go in case one of those great whirlwinds
        arose, mighty enough to crush any building in its path. It was reached by a 
		trap door in the middle of the <strong><span id=noun3></span></strong>, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark hole.</p>
		<p> When <strong><span id=lady2></span></strong> stood in the doorway and looked around,
         she could see nothing but the great  <strong><span id=color1></span></strong>, <strong><span id=Geo1></span></strong> on every side.
         Not a <strong><span id=noun4></span></strong> nor a <strong><span id=noun5></span></strong> broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of the sky in all
         directions. The sun had baked the plowed land into a <strong><span id=color></span></strong> mass, with little cracks running through it. 
         Even the grass was not green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until they were the 
         same color <strong><span id=color1></span></strong> to be seen everywhere. Once the house had been painted, but the sun blistered the paint 
         and the rain washed it away, and now the house was as dull and <strong><span id=color2></span></strong> 
         as everything else.</p>
